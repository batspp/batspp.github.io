    <h3>Enhancement #1: Software Design and Engineering</h3>
    <div class="narrative">
      <p>The artifact I chose to enhance is a reverse-engineered investment application. 
        The original artifact was created on 23 August 2024 and was meant to demonstrate my ability to reverse engineer a legacy application and convert it into a C++ application. 
        The C++ application demonstrated login-type functionality, where users had to authenticate themselves before displaying some (simulated) data.</p>
      <img src="original_images/finc_cpp"
        alt="The assembly main function.">

      <p>Showcasing this artifact demonstrates my ability to reverse engineer a binary executable and convert it into a more modern programming language. 
        I decided to further enhance the functionality of the C++ application by porting the application into Python to take advantage of the robust library of existing modules and create a 
        UI design for this login screen. Additionally, I created the application modularly so that further enhancements can be made efficiently. The original application was a single 
        C++ file with a couple of security vulnerabilities due to the nature of the C++ programming language.</p>

      <p>I met the course outcomes I planned to meet with this enhancement. My goal is to simplify the application’s process and user experience. 
        Turning a console application (only executed within a terminal) into a login screen limits the possibility of adversarial exploits, creates a better experience for the user, 
        and looks more professional. With this first enhancement, I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer 
        solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by implementing a modular software architecture, introducing custom Python packages, utilizing database technology, 
        and taking advantage of Python’s built-in libraries and input handling capabilities.</p>

      <p>As I was creating the Python packages for each functionality present within the application such as authentication, and database operations 
        I realized how complex this process can become if you don’t pay attention. Python’s simple syntax is deceptively confusing when you begin to oversimplify naming conventions. 
        One challenge I faced was that I wasn’t sure how to navigate the different custom packages within the main() function. Adding too much into the main function could quickly devolve 
        the simplicity I was aiming for.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Enhancement #2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
    <div class="narrative">
      <p>  The artifact I chose is a login portion of a console application derived from a legacy investment application. 
      The original binary was disassembled, analyzed, and converted into a C++ console application. 
      For the legacy application, a user had to log in using a username and password to validate credentials and gain access permission to some investment data. 
      This artifact was created on 23 August 2024 to demonstrate my ability to reverse engineer legacy applications into a modern coding language.</p>
      <img src="original_images/main_s.png"
        alt="The assembly main function.">
      <br />
      <img src="original_images/main_cpp.png"
        alt="The C++ converted main function.">
    
      <p>  I chose to use this artifact because I discovered a lot of security vulnerabilities while analyzing the assembly code of the binary file. 
      Securing these vulnerabilities for the C++ conversion added complexity to the original application and increased time complexity to be a trade-off since user input had to be validated (to prevent possible exploits). 
      A loop continuously evaluating user input caused the time complexity to be O(n) at its best case and O(n*m) at its worst. 
      Porting this login application into a Python application that uses Tkinter (a C library for graphics) is a great 
      demonstration of my ability to understand a software application's overarching use cases while implementing them into a user interface (UI). 
      Implementing a UI for the application makes it easier to understand and appears more professional than a command-line application.</p>
      <img src="original_images/original_app.png"
        alt="The C++ application initial entry appearance.">
        <br />
      <img src="enhanced_images/login.png"
        alt="The enhanced login screen GUI.">

      <p>  During this enhancement I demonstrated my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles
      and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solutions while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by improving the time complexity of user validation processes within the application.
    Secondly, I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science by
    utilizing docstrings throughout my Python files which can be used as documentation for the application. 
      Including technical information describing each function with docstrings allows other developers to understand and enhance the existing code
       in the future without having to directly interface with the originator.</p>
    
      <p>  While working through this enhancement process I learned a few tools and concepts. While porting to Python and using existing libraries, I learned about Python's “help()” function. 
      Although unfamiliar with Tkinter (a C-based Python library), I was able to use the help function within a Pycharm terminal to find resources and functions to use during development. 
      I also learned more about standard Python practices, such as namespace checking and utilizing “__init__.py” files to limit access to the custom package code. The biggest challenge I faced was using a 
      new tool in a way that wasn’t explicitly documented within that library’s resource documentation. My personal goal with this project is to maintain simplicity for both technical 
        and non-technical aspects of the application, which is a challenging balance.</p>

        alt="How to utilize the docstrings.">
      <p>This is the auth package docstring being used with the built-in Python help() function within a terminal.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Enhancement #3: Databases</h3>
    <div class="narrative">
      <p>  For this third enhancement, I further enhanced the login screen for the Python application. The original binary was converted into a C++ console application designed based on the inferences 
        of the assembly code of the binary executable. It would simply verify user access permissions, and display information. 
        The new artifact was created on September 27th, 2024, where I was able to enhance it into a fully functional login window after porting the application into Python.</p>
      <img src="original_images/original_failed.png"
        alt="A failed login attempt for the C++ console app.">
      <br />
      <img src="enhanced_images/logn_fail.png"
        alt="Failed login for enhanced artifact.">

      <p>I initially chose this artifact to reflect on security since the original executable had many vulnerabilities. 
        After working on the enhancement of this one artifact I see now that it provides a lot of opportunity to showcase what I learned in Computer Science. 
        The UI of the application demonstrates how I can design an application with the user in mind. 
        The simple straightforward appearance showcases my ability to demonstrate well-founded and innovative techniques, 
        skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</p>
      <img src="enhanced_images/create_fail.png"
        alt="Attempt to create a duplicate user name.">

      <p>I improved docstrings to explain each file thoroughly so that any other developer would have an easier time tracking each component of the application’s files. 
        Once documentation was completed I implemented a database, and hashing so that user credentials are securely stored in a database. I ensured that the username could not be duplicated and that all passwords were encoded, 
        hashed, and salted before storing them in the database. No passwords are stored in memory to maintain a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and design to expose 
        potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.</p>

      <p>I met more outcomes in this enhancement than I anticipated. My enhancement for the database category included using SQLite3 to create a user database for storing user credentials, 
        hashing passwords, parameterizing database queries to prevent SQL injections, and improving docstrings and in-code documentation. These enhancements met the three-course outcomes that I previously stated. 
        My current plan is to keep polishing documentation, and functionality, and deliver this project in an organized and timely manner.</p>
      <img src="enhanced_images/create_success.png"
        alt="Attempt to create a duplicate user name.">

      <p>As I completed and improved the artifact I learned about the importance of accurately abstracting functionality, and how to ensure sensitive data is secured throughout the code-base. 
        First I implemented the hashing function and tested it to ensure I knew how to encode and decode without storing the plain-text password in memory. 
        The biggest challenge I faced was implementing this hashing embedded into the logic of the login screen. 
        I found that having functions with similar names made it extremely confusing especially when I would nest a function within another. 
        One example would be when I embedded the hashing function into the verify function, I unintentionally encoded the password twice when verifying the credentials with what was in the database.</p>

      <p>Abstracting functionality is great, and Pythons’ simple syntax makes working with it extremely pleasing. There is a limit to the simplistic syntax once you do it too much. 
        To prevent having to change multiple calls throughout my code I eventually renamed the function and refactored it to fit the logic I was aiming for.</p>
