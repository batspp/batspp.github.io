    <p>The artifact I chose is a login portion of a console application derived from a legacy investment application. 
      The original binary was disassembled, analyzed, and converted into a C++ console application. 
      For the legacy application, a user had to log in using a username and password to validate credentials and gain access permission to some investment data. 
      This artifact was created on 23 August 2024 to demonstrate my ability to reverse engineer legacy applications into a modern coding language.</p>
